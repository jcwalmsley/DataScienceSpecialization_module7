# I. Executive Summary:  
        ## Add after completing analysis  

---

# II. Problem statement & questions to be answered:  
        ## Assuming I work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at the data set of a collection of cars ("mtcars") I know that;   
        ## They are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and the miles per gallon (mpg) outcome.   
        ## They are particularly interested in the following two questions:  
                ## Q1 “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for 'mpg'”  
                ## Q2 "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

# Grading - Criteria (remove on completion)  

Did the student interpret the coefficients correctly?  

Did the student do some exploratory data analyses?  

Did the student fit multiple models and detail their strategy for model selection?  

Did the student answer the questions of interest or detail why the question(s) is (are) not answerable?  

Did the student do a residual plot and some diagnostics?  

Did the student quantify the uncertainty in their conclusions and/or perform an inference correctly?  

Was the report brief (about 2 pages long) for the main body of the report and no longer than 5 with supporting appendix of figures?  

Did the report include an executive summary?  

YES Was the report done in Rmd (knitr) with pdf output?
