    ## Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry wants our datascience team to look at the data set of a collection of cars ("mtcars") and explore the relationship between a set of variables and the miles per gallon (mpg) outcome.
    ## The two questions they are particularly interested in are the following:
            ## Q1 “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for 'mpg'”
            ## Q2 "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
