Preliminary findings: # Quesions of interest: & interpretation of results:

A Revisit the Question
        A. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for mpg
        B. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual
                transmissions

B Primary result
        A. Are any other regressors significantly correlated with mpg rating?
                a. model fnm6 = factor(am) + cyl + disp + hp + drat + wt
        B. Further testing
                a.

C Direction, Magnitude, Uncertainty
        A. am - positive,
        B. wt - negative,
        C. qsec - negative,

D Context
        A.

E Implications - Congruence with existing knowledge?
        A. Sedan, Sports, Luxury


To answer the question of whether automatic or manual transmissions are better for gas mileage
we will look at vehicles with roughly the same design components  as possible using this given
data set.  Such a comparison is best shown in figure XXXXX


Our results of diagnostic testing that a small number of vehicles exhibit a degree of leverage
and influence over the "MPG" analysis results at both ends of the ratings. The following
vehicles!!!!!!!
