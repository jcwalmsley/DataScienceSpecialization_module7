Analysis considerations:

Descriptive - any(is.na()), str() & summary(),

Exploratory - pairs_Plots(), histograms(), box_Plots(), bar_Plots() QQ_Plots & multiple plots

Regression Models Analysis -
        SLR, BiVariate Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression, model selection,
        adjustments, residuals (predict fit, residual fit (-1)), coeficients, correlation,
        confidence intervals, influence & leverage,

Final Model Selection strategy
        Beginning with the simmple linear regression using just one predictor (am)
        Use a bivariate model
        Use a multivariate model
        Use an intercept adjusted multivariate model
        Use a multivariate model removing a suspected key regressor
        Use the nested multivariate process
        Use the step(function) both directions process
        Use diffent combinations and leave out from the results of the step(function)
        Choose the simplest to explain
