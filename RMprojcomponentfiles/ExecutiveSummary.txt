Executive Summary:

Using a broad range of linear regression model variations including the step function to gauge
model fit we identified a model with (wt + qsec + am) that provides an 84.966 R^2 value
inidicating a reasonalby good fit and closeley matched a slightly different fit devloped using the
manual nested approach followed by and anova table test to check for multicollinearity which
also produced a reasonably good fit with an R^2 value of 85.13%. It must also be noted that
vehicle weight is highly correlated (-86.77%) with mpg ratings and transmission type is
relatively highly correlated with vehicle wieght at (69%).
