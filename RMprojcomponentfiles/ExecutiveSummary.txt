Executive Summary:

The mean "MPG" rating of all vehicle models including both transmission types is 20.091 mpg
with a 95% confint of 17.917mpg to 22.263mpg.

The mean "MPG"  of models with automatic transmisions is 17.147 mpg, and those with manual
transmisions 24.392 mpg for a difference of 7.24 mpg in favor of the manual transmission in
the given data set.

Using a braod range of linear regressoin model variations including the step function to gauge
best model fit we idendified a model using (wt + qsec + am) that provides an 84.966 R^2 value
inidicatinwhich practically matches a slightly different fit that was devloped using the manual
nested approach followed by and anove table test to check for multicollinearity which also
produced a reasonably good fit with an R^2 value of 85.13%.

It must also be noted that vehicle weight is highly correlated (-86.77%) with mpg ratings and
transmission type is relatively highly correlated with vehicle wieght at (69%).
