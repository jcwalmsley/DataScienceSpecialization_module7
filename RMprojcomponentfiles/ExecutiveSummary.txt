Executive Summary:

Using linear regression model variations, including the step function, to gauge model fit,
we identified model fa <- lm(mpg ~ (wt + qsec + am), data= mtcars) that provides an 84.966
R^2 value indicating a reasonalby good fit and another model fit fb <- lm(mpg ~ I(cyl + disp
+ hp + drat + wt + factor(am), data = mtcars) devloped using the multivariate nested approach
followed by and anova table test to check for multicollinearity which also produced a reasonably
good fit with an R^2 value of 85.13%. It must also be noted that vehicle weight is highly
correlated (-86.77%) with mpg ratings and transmission type is relatively highly correlated
with vehicle wieght at (69%).
