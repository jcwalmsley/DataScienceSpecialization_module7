Background information relating to the analysis:

"You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry.""

"Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome)."

"They are particularly interested in the following two questions:"


## Q1 “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for 'mpg'”
## Q2 "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
---

## Q1R Which transmission types is associated with higher mpg ratings: automatic or manual?

## Q2R What is the estimated mpg difference between the two types of transmissions?

## Q3 What are the conficence levels or our estimates?
## Q4 What are the associated confidence intervals of these estimates?


Assumptions:
Given data set for this analysis consists of independent and identically distrubuted random varialbles iid for 32 vehicles or subjects with 11 variables or observations
