        Background situation:
                As a member of a team of data analysts for the Motor Trend Magazine we have been given
                a data set called "mtcars" and asked to answer some questions of interest concerning
                differences between automatic and  manual transmissoin types in regards to associated
                mpg or miles per gallon ratings in this data set.
        Assumptions:
                The given data set (a sample of a unknown larger population) for this analysis consists
                of (iid) independent and identically distrubuted random varialbles for 32 subjects
                (vehicles) of 11 observations or variables.

                Questions of interest for Motor Trend Magazine:

                Q1 “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for 'mpg'”
                        or which type of transmission is associated with better mpg or gas mileage ratings?

                        A1. The mean "mpg" rating of all vehicle models including both transmission types
                        is 20.09 mpg with a 95% confidence interval of 17.92 mpg to 22.26 mpg.

                Q2 "Quantify the mpg difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
                        What is the expected difference in mpg rating and how accurate
                        is this estimate based on the given data?

                        A2. The mean "mpg" of models with automatic transmisions is 17.15 mpg, with a 95%
                        confidence interval of between 14.85 mpg to 19.44 mpg and vehicles with manual
                        transmisions have a mean of 24.39 mpg for a difference of 7.24 mpg with a 95 %
                        confidence interval of between 18.49 mpg and 30.29 mpg

        Prediction:
                Hypothesis
                General automotive industry knowledge indicates that:
                        typically luxury cars have automatic transmissions
                        typically luxury cards weigh more than other models
                        typically luxury cars have lower mpg ratings than other models
                        typically sports cars are lighter
                        typically sports cars are faster
                        typically sports cars have manual transmissions
                        typically sports cars have lower mpg ratings than other models
                        typically sedans are family cars
                        typically sedans are slower than sports cars and lighter than luxury cars
                        typically sedans have either manual or automatic transmissions
                        typically sedans have higher mpg ratings than sports cars or luxury cars

                Based general automotive industry information we propose the following hypothesis:

                H0 = mean(automatic transmission)mpg  <   mean(manual transmission)mpg
                Ha = mean(automatic transmission)mpg  >=  mean(manual transmission)mpg

                        qt = quantile
                        confint = confidence intervals



                Q6 Are there any other models which have greater predictability that can be found through exploratory data analysis?
                        1) weight or (weight + am)
                        2) qsec or (qsec + am)
                        3) (weight + qsec) or (weight + qsec + am)



                Q7 If so, were diagn0sitic tests conducted to veriify their ability to provide better predictability and what were those results?
