2       Backround information, problem statement & questions of interest:
                Background situation:
                        As a member of a team of data analysts for the Motor Trend Magazine we have been given a data set called "mtcars"
                        and asked to answer some questions of interest concerning differences between automatic and manual transmissoin types
                        in regards to associated mpg or miles per gallon ratings within the given data set.
                Assumptions:
                        The given data set (a sample of a larger population) for this analysis consists of (iid) independent and identically distrubuted random varialbles for 32 subjects (vehicles) of 11 observations or variables.

        Questions of interest for Motor Trend Magazine:
                Q1 “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for 'mpg'”
                        or which type of tramsmission is associated with better mph or gas mileage ratings?

                Q2 "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
                        or assuming there is an associated difference in mpg ratings between manual and automatic type transmissions then:
                        What is the expected difference and how accurate is this estimate based on the given data?
        Related questions:

                Q3 What is the mean mpg for manual and for automatic transmissions?

                Q4 What is are the confidence intervals related to the mean mpg rating for manual and automatics
                        or with a 95% confidence level the values of the means are between x1 and x2

                Q5 What is the standard error and variaince of those estimates?
                        or the standard error of these two estimates are: a & b

        Prediction:
                Hypothesis
                General automotive industry knowledge indicates that:
                        typically luxury cars have automatic transmissions
                        typically luxury cards weigh more than other models
                        typically luxury cars have lower mpg ratings than other models
                        typically sports cars are lighter
                        typically sports cars are faster
                        typically sports cars have manual transmissions
                        typically sports cars have lower mpg ratings than other models
                        typically sedans are family cars
                        typically sedans are slower than sports cars and lighter than luxury cars
                        typically sedans have either manual or automatic transmissions
                        typically sedans have higher mpg ratings than sports cars or luxury cars

                Based general automotive industry information we propose the following hypothesis:

                H0 = mean(automatic transmission)mpg  <   mean(manual transmission)mpg
                Ha = mean(automatic transmission)mpg  >=  mean(manual transmission)mpg

                        qt = quantile
                        confint = confidence intervals



                Q6 Are there any other models which have greater predictability that can be found through exploratory data analysis?
                        1) weight or (weight + am)
                        2) qsec or (qsec + am)
                        3) (weight + qsec) or (weight + qsec + am)



                Q7 If so, were diagn0sitic tests conducted to veriify their ability to provide better predictability and what were those results?
